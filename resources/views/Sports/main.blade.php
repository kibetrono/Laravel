The retrieval process becomes also a challenge to the illiterate individuals since in order to choose the correct and required option, one has to be at least knowledgeable enough to select from the provided options. The web guide system is  very convenient in improving the existing system which have got more challenges in their tasks of handing back their responses to the clients.
The task of ensuring that users get satisfied with all their request using minimal and short procedure is a major goal and objective of these systems and it should always be rendered to the clients by designing them a quick and a user friendly systems.
The conventional approach of retrieving data and information using existing systems is at some point a tiresome process hence there is a call for convenient systems that isnâ€™t time consuming and also be efficient to ensure clients spend a little to receive whatever they request.
Current systems have become unreliable for they do not render what the users expect as well as minimizing the scope of its users since it becomes a challenge for most individuals who failed or were unlucky to receive knowledge from schools. Systems have to be developed which solves or otherwise minimize these challenges and problems.</p>
